This is a repository of materials and resources for the [research education & development retreat](www.readr.org.au).

## Resources for the retreat

You'll need to install Anaconda. Ensure you have the following libraries:

* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* memory_profiler
* jupyter_contrib_nbextensions

Which are easily installed from the command line. First, verify your pip/conda version by calling

conda -V

After which you can install all of the packages above with

conda install -c conda-forge ase packagename


# Resources for research

Some useful tools for managing projects, workflow, time, (& etc) are over in [this repository](https://github.com/GroundhogState/workflow)

At the ANU, the [Academic skills & learning centre](http://www.anu.edu.au/students/contacts/academic-skills) have lots of resources for managing research projects, and the [ANU counselling centre](http://www.anu.edu.au/students/health-safety-wellbeing/counselling) are available as a 'prefrontal cortex for hire'. It's been a pleasure to work with both in building the retreat.
