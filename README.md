# readr

Hello, and thank you for taking the leap of faith to join the retreat.
This is only the second iteration of the retreat. You, the students, are uniquely placed to help improve the experience for future generations.
It would be a great help if you could fill out [this anonymous survey](https://goo.gl/forms/PcKmcCjAmbD6SLR62).
Afterwards, please remain in the dining hall for a closing discussion. After that, you're free.

Thank you <3

## Resources for the retreat
Hello!

You should already have installed Anaconda. Ensure you have the following libraries:

* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* memory_profiler
* jupyter_contrib_nbextensions

Which are easily installed from the command line. First, verify your pip/conda version by calling

conda -V

After which you can install all of the packages above with

conda install -c conda-forge ase packagename


# Resources for research

Some useful tools for managing projects, workflow, time, (& etc) are over in [this repository](https://github.com/GroundhogState/workflow)

At the ANU, the [Academic skills & learning centre](http://www.anu.edu.au/students/contacts/academic-skills) have lots of resources for managing research projects, and the [ANU counselling centre](http://www.anu.edu.au/students/health-safety-wellbeing/counselling) are available as a 'prefrontal cortex for hire'. It's been a pleasure to work with both in building the retreat.
