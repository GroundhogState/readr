# readr_2019
Hello!

This repo contains the software required for workshops at the 2019 chapter of the research education & development retreat.



You should already have installed Anaconda. It's a large installer, though, so if you haven't perhaps consider installing miniconda https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html


You'll need the following libraries:

numpy
scipy
matplotlib
memory_profiler
emcee
pandas
seaborn
jupyter_contrib_nbextensions

Which are easily installed from the command line. First, verify your pip/conda version by calling

conda -V

After which you can install all of the packages above with

conda install package1 package2...
Followed by
conda install -c conda-forge ase jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
