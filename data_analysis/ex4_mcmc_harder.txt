Background: fitting for cosmological parameters Omega_m and w (for model=wCDM)
or Omega_m (for model=LCDM, i.e. fixing w=-1), and a few other 'nuisance'
parameters alpha, beta, M_1_B, Delta_M.

The script ex4_mcmc_harder.py has some parts missing (search TODO), which you
are to fill in:

0. load in data from jla_lcparams.txt

1. try make a useful plot of the data

2. lnlike: you are given mu_obs, mu_theory
a) estimate chisq using diagonal errors only (as a first approximation, use errors in mb only)
b) estimate covariance matrix Ceta using covmat_tridiagonal (you are given this)

3. try running MCMC with different numbers of walkers, steps. make some plots.
plots should in theory look something like ex4_LCDM_plot.png (for LCDM model).
what is a good amount of burn in?

4. feel free to go back to MCMC questions in ex2 and ex3 at any point
